# Project: Chat Bot 

This week’s project is to practice some parts of JavaScript you've learnt so far by creating a chat bot!

My bot is called The Java Place. Here you can order som hot or cold coffee from the bot Mr Coffee Bean. 🤖

## How did I do it?
I started the project by going through the literations that were given for this week. One by one I read them and did the exercise. And it wasn’t until the 4th day of reading and looking at materials that I started coding.

What I learned:
* This week it was 99% JavaScript. And I have learned SO much!  I have learned about variabels, conditionals, booleans, strings, data types, … well the list goes on. It has been really really really though, but at the same time so educational and enlightening. It’s like learning a whole new language - and you have to write with the right grammar.👩‍💻

* To make up a story for the bot and then make it interact was really fun and I had so much fun doing it. To write JavaScript for the first time was challenging, frustrating, funny and scary. It has been a roller coaster of emotions. 🎉

* "Trial and error” is my mantra - I have to accept that programming for me is two steps ahead one step back. 

When I hit a dead end or a problem
When a problem arose, I either googled, used dev-tools or asked my husband (he is a back-end developer). 

My own reflection
This week was intense and I have to accept that I will not understand JS fully in months or even in years. I feel that I have to take baby steps when it come to this programming language.
